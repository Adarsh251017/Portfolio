      <h4>I'm <span>Adarsh Kumar</span>
      a final-year Computer Science and Data Analytics student at IIT Patna
      with a passion for frontend development and user experience. </h4><br>
      <br>My projects reflect my detail-oriented approach 
      and love for iterative improvement—whether it's refining a portfolio or adding subtle animations,
      I aim to make every design recruiter-ready. <br>
      <br>Currently, <br>
      <br>I'm preparing for internships and placements, focusing on polishing my portfolio and showcasing my skills to the industry.
      <br>
  
      <br>Beyond coding, <br>
      <br>I value persistence, adaptability, and continuous learning.
      <br>For me,
      <br>every project is not just a task, but an opportunity to grow and create something impactful.
